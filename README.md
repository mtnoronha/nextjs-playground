## What is this?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM with MySQL.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for the UI.


## Why?

My plan is to use Next.js in the near future thus this is my initial playground to test things and see how it works.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
